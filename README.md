# Lab 8: AI Service Layer ‚Äì Local and Cloud LLM Integration

## Overview
This lab builds upon **Lab 7‚Äôs MVC Chat Application** by introducing an **AI Service Layer** that allows the chat to switch between different language model (LLM) providers such as OpenRouter and Groq.  
The goal is to create a modular system that can easily integrate or replace AI providers using abstraction patterns like **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture)**.

The project explores real-world engineering practices such as secure API key management, asynchronous programming, and automated E2E testing with Playwright.

### Key Themes
- **Service Abstraction:** Isolate AI logic from MVC using a shared service interface.
- **Dependency Injection:** Allow dynamic switching between providers without changing core code.
- **API Integration:** Implement real HTTP requests to OpenRouter and Groq.
- **Security Awareness:** Manage API keys safely in-browser via prompts and `localStorage`.
- **Async Programming:** Handle AI replies with Promises and `async/await`.
- **Automated Testing:** Use Playwright to perform end-to-end chat flow tests.

---

## Project Goals
By the end of this lab, the application will:
1. Integrate an **AI Service Layer** capable of selecting between local (Eliza) and cloud (OpenRouter, Groq) AI providers.
2. Support dynamic switching through a **provider dropdown** in the UI.
3. Store API keys securely (prompt once, save temporarily).
4. Maintain existing **CRUD** and **persistence** functionality from Lab 7.
5. Demonstrate two R&D experiments (OpenRouter and Groq) with real API calls.
6. Include **Playwright tests** for both local and cloud chat modes.
7. Publish the live app link for grading.

## Design Decisions
### üí≥ Reason for Selecting Groq and openRouter
> I selected **OpenRouter** and **Groq Cloud** because both providers issue API keys without requiring a credit card or billing setup.  
> This project is educational, and I wanted to avoid sharing personal financial information with AI providers.  
> Both services also expose OpenAI-compatible JSON endpoints, which made integration straightforward and secure.

---

## Design Decisions

### Model (`src/model.js`)
- Reused from Lab 7 for CRUD operations and `localStorage` persistence.
- Handles `addMessage`, `updateMessage`, `deleteMessage`, `clearMessages`, and JSON import/export.
- Used unchanged, since AI Service logic occurs only in `controller.js`.

---

### View (`src/view.js`)
- Reused from Lab 7 with light extensions:
    - Added `provider-select` dropdown (`<select id="provider-select">`) for AI mode switching.
    - Added API key input field and ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button for future integrations.
    - Retained message count badge and scroll-to-bottom behavior.
- No direct DOM manipulation for AI handled here‚ÄîView remains display-only.

---

### Controller (`src/controller.js`)
The Controller was **significantly enhanced** to integrate cloud AI logic while preserving the MVC pattern.
I added a new feature where the edit chat now prompts a new response.

#### üîß Key Additions
- **Provider Switching:**  
  Dropdown lets users toggle between `Eliza (Local)` and `Groq`.  
  The selected provider is saved to `localStorage` under `chat_provider`.
- **Groq Integration:**  
  When Groq is active, user messages are sent to  
  `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`  
  with the model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- **API Key Management:**  
  Prompts the user for their Groq key once, then saves it in `localStorage` as `groq_Key`.  
  No key is ever committed to Git.
- **Message Editing Re-Prompt:**  
  When a user edits a message:
    1. The old bot reply immediately following that message is deleted.
    2. The edited message triggers a fresh AI response (Groq or Eliza).
    3. The conversation updates dynamically without a reload.
- **Async/Await:**  
  Network calls to Groq‚Äôs endpoint use `fetch()` wrapped in async functions for clarity.
- **Error Handling:**  
  If the Groq API fails, an `(AI error)` placeholder is displayed in chat.
